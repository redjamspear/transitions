# SWUP

So I need to be extremely clear that I have no idea how any of this works. I just blindly followed instructions ~~like a trained seal~~ with no idea what I was supposed to do when they didn't entirely work.

I realised I wanted to transition in some way between the various pages instead of a hard cut (because y'know, it's meant to feel like a dander around a village, not just   __l o o k i n g  a t    a   w e b s i t e__ )and afer doing a bit of digging, this [custom library](https://swup.js.org) seemed to be a perfect solution.


So I watched this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzD-cPhq02E&list=PLmw3Tk8vtDShKZSCODBIU8G01_pG5daKt&index=6&t=573s) and followed it to the letter.
Everything went well until it didn't. So. Here we are. Hopefully you can help me figure this out?
